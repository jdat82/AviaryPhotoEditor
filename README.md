# Aviary Photo Editor

## Overview

This a basic demo of the node-webkit engine and the Aviary SDK.

**This demo requires node-webkit >= v0.11.5.**

## Goals

The goal of the project was to learn some cool technologies. 

First, I wanted to test the new kid : node-webkit. I love the ground concept. 
I thought it would be a good way to discover node while continuing to learn HTML5.

In the HTML5 area, I wanted to experiment with:
* SVG animations
* CSS animations
* a tutorial library like Chardin or Tourist
* CSS filters like blur, desaturate, etc.
* Jade templates
* A better gruntfile organization with load-grunt-config

In the node area, I wanted to experiment with:
* fs operations
* Q promises
